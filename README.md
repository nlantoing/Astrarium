# Open solarsystem database #


After many personal projects which involved the solar system and having to get all the different datas I needed by hand I decided to create this project.


The goal is simply to build an SQLite database with a bunch of script to export it in differents formats (mongoDB, XML etc)


### Work in progress ###


### INSTALL ###

> pip install .

Initialize the database :


> python database.py db init


###Â UPGRADE ###

> python database.py db upgrade

### TESTS ###

Run tests :

> pytest
